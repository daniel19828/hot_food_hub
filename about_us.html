        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    
   <div class="about_us" style="float: left; margin: .5em;">    
        
    <p>Since we started Hot Food Hub, we’ve connected warm hot meals with thousands of people in the greater Seattle area . We’re growing by the day!
While this is fantastic news, it also means that our resources are being stretched thin and there is a lot of work that needs to be done. In order to make sure that each and every person that goes on https://www.hotfoodhub.com enjoys the full range of hot meal services that we aim to provide our team is constintely looking for well rounded organizations that can be added to our platform. If there is an organization providing good home cooked food even one day out of the week, please <a href="contact.php">email us</a>with the information and we will be sure to add them to our growing database of Hot Meal Locations.</p>
        
    <p>For the volunteers at Hot Food Hub Inc. this is our “Feeding Schedule”, like any other schedule we believe its important to keep our users updated with current Hot Meal information, closures, and of coarse new “Spots” to meet up with friends and enjoy some good home cooked food.</p>
        
      <p>Keeping our “Mission Statement” clear and consistent by which we are proud to make known “Hot Food Hub Inc. provides only one service and thats connecting hungry people with a hot meal in the most friendly way possible”. Of coarse we have many ideas and creative plans that would involve focusing our efforts on individual people that use our service to encourage success in there endeavors. A “Ride Share” program to drive elderly and disabled people to Hot Meal Locations 3 days a week and offering weekend “journeys” are programs we are currently working on and hope to get started in the near future. </p>  
        
<p>Developing a user friendly website that people enjoy going to will always be at the heart of our opperations. With digital technology in every persons phone we believe that our work starts by offering help to people in need at the foundation of a person’s life.  We believe that offering assistance at this level can bring about a sense of peace and comfort that might otherwise be overlooked or otherwise might go unnoticed by people who otherwise struggle every day just to survive. 
</p>
         

<p>Currently our mission has become very challenging, though its only one service we provide we aim to provide this service in the best way possible.  Developing our platform in hopes that we can become much more involved by integrating the use of Artificial Intelligence software and systems throughout areas of our website could possibly become a big part of every day life for those in need. 
</p>
<p>One of those areas we are currently in the process of designing and developing code that would allow every user the ability to identify special dietary needs specific to each person as there health may require there own special "diet" to be uniquely developed using A.I. systems and software. We believe that providing our users an experience second to none when they are looking for help is the only way to do business. We want them to feel like there is a team of people, a community of people working through this platform to make finding a hot meal a pleasant experience.
       </p>
 <p>   
       When a person is down on there luck, or having a hard time moving through life we want them to feel a warm, comforting hand of help when they look for something to eat. Every member of Hot Food Hub Inc. works hard to represent the community we live in to be that helping hand, and we strive daily to engineer a viable representation of Gods Love within the structure of our website, platform, and modular technology. We understand how difficult it can be when life has turned upside down.
    
       </p>
     <p>
    These situations are extremely volatile, emotions and feelings can be as unpredictable as ever, we aim to improve a small fraction of their life through our platform seamlessly, perhaps even unnoticed creating a sense of security every person should live with daily in our great nation. We recognize the importance of  
    
    nutrition and access to nutritious meals, consuming a well balanced diet, and having access to a wide range of food from all of the food groups as most important and we hop to be the tip of the digital spear in retrospect. These areas of a persons life strugel that we hope to ease may just be the remedy many are in need of.
