  <h6>The cost of living in the Greater Seattle area can be nullifyed by engaging with community organizations two or three times per week. For those struggeling to make ends meet free hot dinners are available 7 days a week.</h6>
        
    <p>We found that newly placed members of our community that have earned there way through transitional programs now live in a apartment of there own. Much of the time, these people now have there own apartment to live in however they may be jobless, disabled, or going through reabilitation treatment programs for many different reasons.</p>
        
    <p>These permante living units are being built all over the greater Seattle area, and many are in place now, each building housing around 400 people.</p>
        
    <p>Those of us at Hot Food Hub Inc., are witness to the success of these programs, and many of us are currently participateing in one way or another with the wrap around services each building provides. Each building has a different director with a different menu of these wrap around services available to its in-building residents.</p>
        
        <p>Personaly, I and other members of our team have either lived in or have immediate family currently living in these newly developed buildings. After, years of planning, brainstorming, designing, developing, and finaly implementing we came up with the best program
        we thought could help those people that have been transitioned from the streets into permante buildings</p>
        
    <p>We came up with Hot Food Hub Inc., currently known as https://www.hotfoodhub.com.</p>    
      
with resources that a person can realize that the food is high quality, fresh, and worth waiting in line for. By practicing this common resource, a person can save an enormous amount of money while developing relationships with those of common interest. Its is what you see in a situation that defines you, not the people around youthat a person can effectively rescind State and Federal resources readily available near you.</h6>
        
    <p>    
        The ability to utilize this resource even 3 days a week to subsidize a person's income can make a significant differene in the cost of living in the greater Seattle area. The cost of living in the greater Seattle area has been increasing for years. the difference so much that these hot meals can be the glimmer of light and hope that people hold dear while they pray and work through the difficulties of their hardships, struggles, and Covid-19.
