            We focus on everyone from all walks of life to enjoy the services that our great State offers. This is why we have designed and developed a user-friendly website that works a lot like an app, (without the logging on and signing up) to help you find a location that will provide you with a free hot meal. And, with just a push of a button Google Maps will take you there.
    </p>
         
    <p>

            The ability to utilize this resource even 3 days a week to subsidize a person's income can make the difference so much that these hot meals can be the glimmer of light and hope that people hold dear while they pray and work through the difficulties of their hardships, struggles, and Covid-19.
