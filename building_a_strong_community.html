 <h2>Providing the tools that allow us to achieve success.</h2>        

  <p>Finding the correct tools for a person to succeed can be challenging, especially when this person has rarely experienced anything but failure and poverty. This platform provides the tools that disadvantaged members of our community need in order to begin to approach the difficulties a tax paying member of society needs to succeed. The cost of living in the Greater Seattle area can be nullified by engaging with community organizations two or three times per week. For those struggling to make ends meet free hot dinners are available 7 days a week.</p>
        
    <p>We found that newly placed members of our community that have earned there way through transitional programs now live in an apartment of their own. Much of the time, these people now have their own apartment to live in however they may be jobless, disabled, or going through rehabilitation treatment programs for many different reasons.</p>
        
    <p>These permante living units are being built all over the greater Seattle area, and many are in place now, each building housing around 400 people.</p>
        
    <p>Those of us at Hot Food Hub Inc., are witness to the success of these programs, and many of us are currently participating in one way or another with the wrap around services each building provides. Each building has a different director with a different menu of these wrap around services available to its in-building residents.</p>
        
        <p>This is where large Database systems could be implemented within the wire-frame of hfhub, providing millions of giga-bites of useable data regarding the people we love and what it's going to take to make them successful. By understanding a persons needs, and a persons hardships we can analyze data thats captured during empirical moments during and immediately after personal triumph. Data that can be sourced from personal moments of a persons hardship, and more importantly while that person climbs the mountain of pain, and poverty finally overcoming these hurdles to stand on the many pinnacles of success. With careful analyzation and proper preparation we believe that the ability to match useful wrap around services on a large scale can be achieved through platforms like hfhub.com, which will open the doors to effectively help many more disadvantaged people.</p>
        
        <p>
        Hot Food Hub Inc., Services provides equal access to services to individuals without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, marital status, families with children, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, veteran or military status, or the presence of a physical, sensory, or medical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a disabled person.

        After, years of planning, brainstorming, designing, developing, and finally implementing we came up with the best program
        we thought could help those people that have been transitioned from the streets into permanent buildings,</p>
            
    </div>
    
    
      <div class="donations">       
        
    <p>We came up with Hot Food Hub Inc., currently known as https://www.hotfoodhub.com.</p>    
    </div>
    
     <div class="donations">
          
<p>
    Let's face it, once many of these highly vulnerable people are moved from shelters into permanent housing it's only then that the real challenge can begin. After talking to many residents at one very successful permanent housing building "Patrick Place Apartments" which opened it's doors in 2013 I began to realize the full scope of the problems those people transitioning from shelters to permanent housing face. The struggle is real and the obstacles are many however, having the ability to locate and be taken to a free hot meal easily without confusion is a start in the right direction.
</p>
         
<p>
    With the correct platform in place full of the tools and resources that these people truly need the team at Hot Food Hub Inc., truly believes that a person can make huge improvements in their life by achieving personal goals, progressing in their treatment programs, keeping themselves healthy, and even finding part time or full time employment which gives a person a feeling of fulfillment, self-worth, and ultimately success.

    <h2>Watching Those that are Disadvantaged become Successful and Positive Community Members. </h2>
   
<p>
    Organizing resources that are currently available onto a useable, friendly digital platform is exactly what our impoverished community needs. A "Hub" to find what they need, where to get it, and then the perfect API to take them there. Thats what we are working on at hfhub.com. With the perfect balance of UI/UX elements contained on our social services platform we are sure that community members that are transitioning off the streets, out of bad situations, and away from dangerous people is exactly what they need.
